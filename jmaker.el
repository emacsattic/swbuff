;;; Description:

;; This package is an add-on to the Java Development Environment
;; (JDE) for Emacs. It automatically generates Makefiles to improve
;; Java projects building using make. The default Makefile template
;; provided uses the java compiler and its options from JDE and generate
;; targets to compile all .java files in the current directory.
;;
;; jmaker can generate "meta Makefiles" too, which could be used to
;; build sets of projetcs. "meta Makefiles" recursively call make on
;; Makefiles found in a directory tree.

;;; Installation:

;; Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;   (require 'jmaker)
;;
;; As jmaker does (require 'jde) you can omit it in your .emacs.

;;; Usage:

;; While editing a Java file use:
;;   M-x `jmaker-generate-makefile' to generate a new Makefile in the current
;;   directory. If an old one already exists the command requires confirmation
;;   to overwrite it.
;;
;;   M-x `jmaker-generate-meta-makefile' to generate a new meta Makefile in the
;;   asked directory. If an old meta Makefile already exists the command requires
;;   confirmation to overwrite it.
;; 
;; CAUTION: jmaker doesn't take back any modifications you could have made
;; to an existing Makefile!
;;
;; To build a project with make you can use the `compile' command or the
;; `jde-build' command if `jde-build-use-make' is set to a non-nil value.
;; To build a set of projects you can use the `compile' command and give it
;; the file name of the meta Makefile (make [other options] -f Makefile.meta)

;;; Customization:

;; While editing a Java file use:
;;   M-x `jmaker-customize' to change jmaker options
;;
;; If the `jmaker-hook-jde-menu' variable is non-nil (the default) the JDE
;; `Generate' and `Options' sub-menus will have respectively new `Makefile'
;; and `meta-Makefile' items to generate Makefiles and a new `jmaker' item
;; to change jmaker options. The jmaker version number is also added to the
;; JDE `Help' sub-menu.

;;; Support:

;; Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.
;; Please send them to David Ponce at david.ponce@wanadoo.fr.
;;
;; This version of jmaker is developed and tested with NTEmacs 19.34.6 and
;; Cygnus GNU-Win32 B18 tools (bash, make) under MS Windows NT 4 WKS SP3.
;; jmaker requires the "jde" package (works with jde 2.0.7, 2.0.8 and
;; probably might work with slightly earlier and later versions).
;; Please, let me know if jmaker work with other OS and versions of GNU Emacs.
